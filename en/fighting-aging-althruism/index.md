# Fighting aging as effective altruism cause: model of impact
A.Turchin, M. Batin, N.Egorova, E.Milova, D. Denkenberger

**Abstract**: One could measure altruistic effectiveness of investment by amount of good it created. “Effective altruists” aim to use reason to maximize the amount of good done in the world. If human life is of ultimate value, one could measure this effectiveness by number of saved lives. In the future, the technology of radical life extension will be achieved. Anyone who survives until then would gain potentially indefinite life extension. Fighting aging increases the number of people who would survive until radical life extension. We suggest a simple model, where radical life extension is achieved in 2100, human population is 10 billion, and life span is increased by simple geroprotectors like metformin on around 10 more years, so nearly 1 more billion people survive until “immortality”, and the cost of experiments to prove that metformin is real geroprotector is 65 mln USD. In this simplified case price of a saved life is around 7 cents, which is 10 000 times better than saving humans from malaria by bednets.

Fighting aging should not be done instead of fighting existential risks. Total budgets of x-risks research are much smaller than total aging related research. More egoistic sources, which combine altruism with self-interest, could be tapped for funding aging. Effective altruists themselves have to be alive and of sound mind to be effective, especially in artificial general intelligence safety research. Fighting aging and existential risks (x-risks) prevention is the same idea on different levels: preventing inevitable destruction of complex systems, both valuing human life.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Aging as a largest cause of suffering of Earth now

Most people die because of age-related diseases, which include cancer, cardiovascular diseases etc. Even deaths because of flu, falls, and depression correlate with aging. [Link]

Beyond death, aging also causes suffering, in the individual directly and through impacts on friends and family. Direct impacts include the unbearable suffering of cancer, other end-of-life experiences, as well as depression. Impacts on friends and family include mortality and morbidity. 

Our population is aging: now 524 million people are over 65 and in 2050 it is projected that 1.5 billion will be above the age of retirement. https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/publication/global-health-and-aging/humanitys-aging And much more will die because of age related diseases. Risk of cancer is exponentially growing with age (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4544764/)

People suffer from aging in many different ways: they can’t find work, they can’t father (healthy) children, they more often have chronic pain, sleep problem, depression. They are less active, rarely play sport, rarely meet friends. Their mental performance decline, and dementia is more probable. Their beauty, sex life and libido decline. Their emptions are blunted and become more stereotypical. They lost their memories and can’t learn. They become more obese. They become lonelier. They also sufferer indirectly when their love ones age and die: parents, sibling, friends and even pets.  They know that their condition will only deteriorate.

More people are aging than suffer from hunger. Young people are not suffering from poverty to the same extent as old ones, because young people are healthier, have many opportunities, don’t need expensive medical care. Hunger could end, but aging ends only with death.

### 1.2. Unbearable pain and non-existence as the worst forms of suffering, and aging is their main source

We claim that ending of existence is also a form of suffering, and is even more important than pain. Normal pain is just a signal of the need for a cure. 

But negative value of non-existence is not easy to measure, so utilitarian thinking is biased on measuring easily quantifiable suffering, like pain.

The negative value of non-existence cannot be measured, but if it is agreed that human life has value itself, then every year of life has this value (adjusted by suffering: quality adjusted life years (QALYs)), and death is loss of many future life years.

In this case value of the human life is equal to value of healthy life years, and one could use number of healthy life-years as proxy of how much good one reached. But this metric is only a proxy of the value of human life, as the value may include many more unknown factors.

Currently one cannot save any life for an indefinite time – one simply could add some healthy life years. For example, saving a child is giving her/him the opportunity to live not 10, but ~80 years. But if indefinite life extension is reached, the life could become astronomically long. To escape infinity we could use possible timing of the end of the Universe, which could happen as early as 20 billion years from now  (Big Rip), for estimation of life gain by reaching potentially indefinite life expectancy. Fighting aging can’t provide indefinite life extension, but uploading into Strong AI surely could. 

Death has several other bad features, except of lost healthy life. It converts our consciousness into nothing, and the fear of non-existence is strongest motivation against death for many people. 

It also often comes together with extreme physical and emotional pain and fear. 

And finally it happens in unpredictable time in unpredictable form, which creates constant background of fear and uncertainty for any reasonable human. Even rational unemotional agent can’t predict will he able to finish his projects before death, which could happen in any moment.

In our society unbearable pain is mostly associated with cancer, as it produce longest and strongest pain, which is not easy to manage. And around 9 of 10 of cases of cancer are associated with aging. (It doesn’t exclude other causes, as for example toxic exposure from smoking show itself mostly in second half of life when exposure accumulates and immune system decline.)

Aging is the main cause of non-existence, unbearable pain and loss of healthy life years. (Other causes of suffering are infections, crime, poverty, and bad relationships and depression.)

If cancer is eliminated, life expectancy will increase by three years. [link] However, if aging is slowed, life expectancy could increase decades. If humans achieve the lowest mortality that is available to them in some point of their life, that is if they do not age at all (lowest mortality is around 11 years), their life expectancy will be around 2000 years. Furthermore, mortality at this age is largely due to accidents. If aging is stopped, many more life years could be saved by preventing accidents, so much greater efforts to increase safety would be justified. In addition, non-age-related mortality has fallen dramatically over time, and would likely continue to fall. Therefore, the life expectancy of biological humans alive today would likely be many millennia if aging were stopped.

### 1.3. Aging could be probably delayed by rather simple interventions

Aging has been slowed on many model animals using cheap, safe, long-term tested drugs, like metformin, enalapril, aspirin etc. Aging has been slowed down on mice on tens of per cent by administration of rather simple drugs. But we don’t know how it would transfer on humans without experiments in humans. We have some cohort studies which showed for example that diabetics who took metformin lived longer than healthy people. People who had black pepper in their diet had 6 per cent longer life expectancy according to the recent study. But cohort studies have less proving power when control double blind experiments.

Non-aging animals exist, like mole rat. Their probability of death doesn’t depend of time and they live much longer when similar organisms.

Two very similar species of fish have 10 times difference in life expectancy, but only 13 different genes. We could mimic activity of genes in an organism by inserting proteins they code, or to edit such genes using CRISPR in the future.

Whales could live 200 years, so 200 years is achievable for mammals.

### 1.4. Most potential to fight aging is untapped

Most potential to fight aging is untapped because until recently not much scientific research of slowing aging on humans has been done. 

It is quite likely that some simple intervention would work on slowing aging, but we just not tried them. There is some reasons why aging research is delayed compared to say cancer research.

Research on aging of humans is difficult because aging is not disease in WHO classification.

Many promising geroprotectors-candidates (drugs slowing aging)  can’t be patented as they have existed for decades.

There was an idea that extending human life is immoral even between gerontologists, as it may result in overpopulation (it will not) or larger burden on retirement plans (it will not).

The field has thousand years history of crack pottery and fraud because evidences of success are remote (More on it later).

Many simple experiments, which could be done in the middle of 20 century or earlier, are not done until now. First of all this experiment how different interventions influence life expectancy of human beings. Such experiments may have rather simple design, like take a vitamin all life, but their nature is that they should be longitudinal, that is they have to be as long as human life to get meaningful results. So if such experiments were started in the middle if 20 centuries, we could be able to use their results now. But if we start the same experiments now, they will take decades before they will produce meaningful results.

Many interventions which are known to slow down aging and generally improve health are not implemented by majority of population. This includes healthy diet, more sport and less smoking and drinking. 

Large amount of money are spent on snake oil solutions while really interesting experiments are underfunded. The total market of antiaging supplements and other untested solutions is around 200 bln, and total research budget on aging is around 400 mln USD in NHI and probably the same amount everywhere else.

However, in 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first ever test of metformin to slowing aging. The cost of the experiment is 65 million USD, but nobody provided financing in 2016, so the experiment has not started.

### 1.5. There is a demand for anti aligning, and there is a supply, but they can’t meet

We could use the following metaphor. 

There are two islands, and there is no bridge between them: 

Demand island: One is the island of demand of antiaging and it includes older people, women, who want to be younger, children who want to prevent aging of parents etc. The people, who are old or ill now may regret that they not paid for creation general prevention drugs before. They want to spend a lot to prevent aging. The visible part of this demand is 200 billion spend yerally on non-proved antiaging therapies https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/05/21/737992/10135534/en/Anti-aging-Market-is-estimated-to-be-worth-USD-191-7-Billion-Globally-by-2019-Transparency-Market-Research.html But real part of demand is larger, as most rational customers understand that there is no working solitions now. 

Supply island: And there is another island: scientists, who have ideas how to fight aging, but don’t have money for experiments. 

But there is no bridge between these two islands, because there are 3 types of sharks in the murky waters: scammers, religion and FDA. 

Scammers sell untested solutions and use all revenue for personal advertising. The nature of any anti-aging drug is that real effects can’t be immediately observed, and this results in market failure. But the problem was solved fro vaccination.

Religion and in general traditions are the ways of psychological defense against fear of death. It promised that immortality is already exists in heaven and that life extension is unnatural. So the religion is the biggest scammer here and the biggest seller on the market for immortality. But it is also “Stockholm syndrome”: people take the side of death to escape fear of it and said that it is natural. 

FDA doesn’t recognize aging as a disease, and so farma can’t register clinical trials of antiaging drugs and governments can’t spend of the non-existing disease. 

In recent years there is growing interest to the idea of fighting aging, manifested in creation such companies as Calico. Many governments start to said that life expectancy is great proxy to measure overall good in their country (Russian prime minister Medvedev.) But with growth is not adequate to the problem.

### 1.6. Previous analyses of the cost effectiveness for the case of the SENS foundation

Qwen… http://effective-altruism.com/ea/dh/tentative_thoughts_on_the_sens_foundation/ did comparison of health life years gain by anticancer research and by funding SENS. He concluded that one health year bought by cancer research costs around 3000 USD, and if this money will be used on SENS, the price will be $0.059 for year of life lived.

But it depends of immeasurable probability of success of SENS as well as unknown total time and price of their research, as well as unknown risks and regulation difficulties.

There are also other approaches to slowing aging, and SENS has been suggested before such approaches got scientific basis:
* geroprotectors as simple drugs
* genetic interventions using CRISP: vaccination against aging
* regenerative medicine: stimulating own regenerative potential and using of stem cells
* AI in medicine and personalized medicine based on big data
* Therapeutic cloning: growing body parts and even new bodies

In our case we will study interventions, which almost surely will work, because they already work on many animals. These interventions have predictable price, time and design of experiments to test them. People on their own could implement them as they are based on generally safe available drugs, which are already approved by regulators for other conditions. 

## 2. Simplified mathematical model of cost-effectiveness of life extension by fighting aging

### 2.1 Surviving until radical life extension

Technologies are developing, and they provide possibility of radical life extension by the means of cyborgisation, brain uploading, and nanotech. It will happen gradually in the future, but many people will not survive until this time. 

For simplification we will use is a one-step model, where everybody who survives until 2100 gets “potentially indefinite life extension” (the term has been suggested by Ben Hoertzel for replacing the word “immortality” in personal communication) of thousands and maybe even millions or billion years. They will live as much as they want not limited by involuntary death or any type of suffering.

By many projections, the human population will be ~10 billion people at that time. Their life expectancy, if we account for other improving qualities of life and medicine, but not for specialized anti-aging therapy, will be similar to life expectancу in the most advanced countries in the world now, around 80 years. 

If human life expectancy could be extended 8 years (10 per cent) to that time using some simple and cheap intervention, when 1 billion more people will survive until 2100 and will reach potentially indefinite life extension. Total Earth population will be 11 billions. But to get this benefit, they should start to take aging slowing drugs earlier in their life, like in their 40s (it is ongoing debate when is the best time starting such interventions, and some clinical trials should demonstrate it.) 

People who will be 90 in 2100, will be in their 40s in 2050. So all trials should end to that time and solutions shown be as widely advertised as well as taking vitamins is advertised, so that most people will start to take the drug. (Now one buy combination of drugs, Polypill, that clinically proven to slow done cardiovascular risks and they may be aslo have geroprotectors effects. https://www.polypill.com/Home/WhatIsIt - so this is the type of solution we are speaking about.)

All clinical trail and marketing must finish before 2050. And proving the geroprotectors properties of metformin is quite a long study, which will include several experiments, but all of them can’t start if first prove of concept experiment will not happened.

Human clinical trials of the methformin may demonstrate it as an effective geroprotector that is a drug that slows all signs of aging in humans and increase life span. 

It means that spending now 65 million dollars (check price, link) create an instrument to save 1 billion lives, that is 7 cents on one saved life. The current planned experiment is short and using only several biomarkers of aging, not Hompertz curve of mortality itself, so other experiments will needed to get better prove, but if we not start, we will not get where.

Any year of delay in fighting aging means that around 80 million people will not survive until immortality in 2100 in this model and will die in pain.

### 2.2 Adjusting the model to the reality

The model is simplified, just illustrative of cost effectiveness of fighting aging, but the real solution will be probably more expensive:

The experiment could fail. But there are around 10 equally cheap and safe geroprotectors, including enalopril, aspirin, acarbosa, lithium. One of them or their combination will probably work much better. Adding genetic testing to the experiments could show which people will benefit the most. Whales live 200 years and there is no natural law that prevents humans from slowing aging to the same extent.

Even if a geroprotector is demonstrated, there is no guarantee that people will use it. Many know that smoking and eating sugar is bad, but still engage in these behaviors.

One experiment is not enough to prove anything for sure. We need many experiments, and some of them should be very long, as we need to check how mortality changes, and such experiment could take 10 years and has include thousands people. In current model of clinical trials it will be very expensive, and its result will not be known until 2030s.

But there are several considerations, which made the situation better and could lower price:

The number of survivors could be increased not by slowing aging, but by accelerating the date of radical life extension, or by inventing some other intermediate steps.

There is a crowfunding site for animal testing of some geroprotectors with much smaller budgets (70 000 USD) https://www.lifespan.io/ We could get very meaningful results on larger animals.

There are many projects with large funding like Google Calico, but what they are truly doing is unclear.

One could make customers pay for life extension solution, so at the end it will cost lower or will be even profitable.

It is clear that slowing down aging will be more expensive than just 7 cents per saved life. But in developed countries saving one live costs 1-10 million USD, for example, by improving road safety [Robinson, L.A. 2007. How US government agencies value mortality risk reductions. Review of Environmental Economics and Policy 1(2): 283–299].

Cancer therapy in last year of life could easily cost around a million dollars.

The price of drug cocktail for slowing aging could be made rather low, because most of drug-candidates here are simple molecules with low manufacturing cost.

### 2.3. Other evidences that methformin extends life

Here is small review of lifeextension therapies which works on mice: https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2017/01/24/life-extension-possibilities/ They mentioned: 

“If started at 3 months of age (but not later), metformin increased mean lifespan of female SHR mice by 14%. [4] It also delayed the onset of the first tumor by 22%. Metformin increases the mean lifespan of mice by 4-5%.[7]

Selegiline increases life span of mice on 7 per cent (But it is psychoactive preparate to which humans could build tolerance)

Male mice given tocopherol (an antioxidant) at a dose of 5g/kg of food from 28 weeks of age had 40% longer median lifespan than control, and 17% increased maximal lifespan. But meta analisis showed that it doesn’t increase lifespan on humans.

### 2.4 Several steps to radical life extension
	
The more probable model consists of several steps to life extension, which could be reached earlier, and this several steps model has great advantage that many of now living people are able to survive until 2100, which is the date of radical life extension in previous model. Anyway, it is also only a model, but just more detailed, and it consists of several steps:

* Start using geroprotectors in 2030 and get 10 per cent life extension
* SENS and genetic therapy of aging gives 50 per cent life extension around 2050
* New grown bodies and head in VAT technology gives 100 per cent life extension in 2075
* Uploading into computer and nanotech body gives 10 billion years life expectancy in 2100.

It is not prediction, and it rather conservative as some futurists thinks that many of mentioned things could happen earlier. 

In this model if someone survives until 2075 he has very big chances to survive to 2100 too. So the main problem for currently living people of working age is to survive through the middle of 21 century in this model.

And the one of not many chances they have is to pstart participate personally in the clinical trials of geroprotectors.  (See below on betting strategy on life extension).

### 2.5 The real cost-effective interventions are social changes and value changes

The main problem in fighting aging is not technical, and even not money, but social, rationality and values. The following are several examples how our society fails to connect exiting supply and demand in fighting aging.

People spend around 200 billion dollars on unproved anti-aging therapies https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/05/21/737992/10135534/en/Anti-aging-Market-is-estimated-to-be-worth-USD-191-7-Billion-Globally-by-2019-Transparency-Market-Research.html , most of which are useless supplements or snake oil (so there is no problem of money, there is a problem of how it is spent). It is the problem of rationality from demand side, nature of capitalism and regulation.

A large majority of people, institutions and possibly even effective altruists (EAs) are against life extension in general (but they will fight for their life in case of fire in a house). They are against it on theoretical level, but not on a practical level. They present many ad hoc weak arguments like overpopulation.

Fighting aging could be cheap prophylaxis of remote illnesses, like any type of age related diseases like cancer of cardiovascular. This is similar to vaccination.  

The experiments of slowing aging, which could have been done 40 years ago, still can’t find funding which is only 0,0001 of what people spend on unproved therapies.

Many very rich rational egoists (capitalists) die from aging without trying to stop it.

Contemporary clinical trials are very expensive, and costs around 1000 USD for a person-day. Most of this money goes to hospitals, smaller part on preparing needed papers for protocol and participants typically are not paid. Antiaging trials are not the same as cancer trials, which requires hospitalisation. So they could be croudsorursed using some smartphone app, which controls number of pills taken and some basic parameters, and the result may be analyzed using AI, which would dramatically reduce costs of trials. It is absurd that for 30 people to take a safe pill for 3 month costs 65 millions USD. This may be done by patient organisations in fighting aging, like Open Longevity http://eng.openlongevity.org/ 

Social problem is that while many would like to buy antiaging solutions, it is not easy to cooperate to them to invest in its creation. It’s like a tragedy of the commons.

Rationality problem is that for most actors is not clear that it would be rational for them to have life extension as instrumental goal even if they don’t have it as final value. Rationality problem is also that people continue to buy snake oil solutions and investors invest in Theranos style start-ups, and after it fails, they feel dissatisfaction with all field.

And value problem is that there is set of values that are not interested in life extensions at all, like some traditional religions (but not thaosism) as well as nationalistic values, which are oriented of survival of the group but not individual, and values associated with immediate graduations, which implies so steep discount rates that life extension is not relevant.

So if we find the way to explain people that rational life extension is good, it will be most cost-effective investment, as it will reroute existing antiaging demand and spending on the best life extension science, and 200 bln USD will be enough to make big progress in the topic. 

Many attempts has been done but not worked as intended: Writing books, Creating political parties for life extension, Memes in the internet, Crowdfunding

The search of such PR intervention is also complex and requires another article to discuss. But if we find it, it may be most cost effective, as it doesn’t require donations but rerouting of already existing money flaws.

## 3. Fighting aging and existential risks research

### 3.1. How fighting aging could help in x-risks research

Fighting x-risks is reasonable only if one thinks that human life has value. The same is true for life extension and fighting aging. 

Basically it is one in the same task – preventing death – on two different levels, personal and civilizational.

People, who live longer, have a bigger chance to die from x-risk, so they are more interested in its prevention. Risk aversion is a personal trait and some people are interested in both topics.

But recently EA movement seems to put more emphasis in creating Safe AI than in extending life.

### 3.2. How fighting aging and x-risks may contradict each other

A popular objection is that more research into the biology of aging will increase chances of global catastrophe connected with synthetic biology.

While the risks of biocatastrophe are very serious, they are dominated by the risks of multipandemics created by biohackers or rogue states [Turchin]. Multipandemic results from general exponential progress of biotechnologies, and there is little to be done about it.

In anti-aging research, risk is associated with artificial viruses which deliver genetic therapy, but not with simple chemical geroprotectors.

Dangerous experiments with viruses for self-modification may contribute to the creation of a multipandemic. But such contribution could be made negligibly small if it is done in controlled environment in professional labs. (Lis Parish created and injected herself with viral vectors with genetic therapy out of control environment, which could be alarming).

There are many ways to fight aging, and only genetic therapy by viral vectors pose some global risks.

### 3.3. X-risks is the top priority but other issues should not be ignored

If a global catastrophe is very soon and very probable, like next 10-50 years, there is not much need to fight aging, as most people most likely would die from an x-risk event, but not from aging.  

Even if global catastrophe for significantly lower probability to kill an individual then aging, the global catastrophe affects future generations, so it is still a priority [Beckstead, N. 2013. On the overwhelming importance of shaping the far future. Doctoral thesis. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University.]

Therefore, fighting aging should not be done instead of fighting x-risks. Total budgets of x-risks research are much smaller than total aging related research. 

More egoistic sources, which combine altruism with self-interest could be tapped for such aging funding. 

EA people themselves have to be alive and without significant brain degradation to be effective, especially in artificial general intelligence (AGI) safety research, which require acquisition of large amounts of completely new mathematical information which are much easier for younger brains, and not as much based on expertise as other fields of more traditional safety research. 

Research in aging is adding up and is measurable (not easily because market forces encourage creating snake oil solutions, and work against long term experiments).

X-risks research has been underfunded for years, but now there are many AGI-safety related projects, an there was some concerns of overfunding, which may bias research or create incompatible solutions. 

### 3.4. Preventing aging of x-risks researchers

Many AGI safety researchers (and EA activists) are in their 20s, and it is natural to them to ignore risks of aging at this age. They may rationally expect that they will survive until creation of strong AI any way, so the only difference for them will be whether this AGI is safe or not. 

Creation of safe AGI theory may take decades, and AGI safety researchers will age. Eliezer Yudkowsky is now 37 and Nick Bostrom is 43. Brain aging happens very early and most scientific results are created before 50. [Link] So many of the best brains in the field of AI safety could age before they will create safe AGI theory, or their performance will be suboptimal because of brain aging. 

Brain aging happens unequally in different people, so some could start decline much earlier, and they will most benefit of slowing brain-aging solutions.

## 4. Additional moral considerations

Now we‘ll look how fighting aging corresponds with main ideas of meta-ethics, rationality and decision theory.

### 4.1. Value of evidence in consequentialist ethics

Fighting aging is an action which consequences are rather remote, indirect and probabilistic. No matter how strong a person fight aging he could die from accident or rogue cancer. But some evidences of slowing aging could be measured or felt in 10-20 years from the start of therapy. So fighting aging stands between easily observable consequences and completely unobservable (like wellness of the future generations).

Actions of consequentialist agents depend of remote consequences, which are not easy to observe. Information about local and remote consequences of actions is unequal. Local information is cheaper to obtain and more reliable. This is always missed in trolley-like-thought-experiments, where everybody somehow are able to know everything with 100 per cent certainty. But number of people on the rail is always covered with fog of uncertanity.

This asymmetry creates several problems: 

* “Curses” – the special type of biases, which appear in optimization processes. Unilateralist curse, Winner curse and Auction curse. Because of the curses most cost-effective investments are probably based on an error. As a result most biased and dangerous consequentialists actions will dominate, and it will create bad PR for the movement. Unilaterlist curse [Bostrom] may exaggerate activities of most biased members of the EA movement. Optimiser curse http://lesswrong.com/lw/76k/the_optimizers_curse_and_how_to_beat_it/ where most biased group take most drastic action, similar to Winner curse https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner's_curse 
* Blackmail susceptibility 
* Evidence faking

In case of fighting aging the most important one is faking of the evidences, which combines with optimizer curse and make people to buy the most promising but least tested solutions.

### 4.2. Negative value of going all-in in one cause in EA

Fighting aging is one of many goods. It should not be been neither absolute prioritize nor ignored.

Human values are very diverse, and a person who is concentrated on one value is regarded as a maniacal or dangerous, and there is a mathematical reason for it.
(link) 

Any agent who maximizes a finite subset of parameters will try to put other parameters at extreme values.

### 4.3. Effective altruist must be alive to be effective

One cannot be an EA if one is dead. 

Even the most dedicated EAs have to take care of themselves; favoring themselves somewhat is built in their value system. If a really effective altruist is continuing his actions as long as possible, he could create much more good, when if he die early.

### 4.4. Rational egoism and Prisoners dilemma in fighting aging

Rational egoism is idea that someone is caring about his own interests (as well as people who actually matter for him) in a rational way.

In case of fighting aging there is no big difference between strategies of rational egoist and effective altruist as fighting aging could be won only as a result of collective efforts that is organizing large-scale scientific experiments. 

In general rational egoist is interested in cooperating in repeated Prisoners dilemma.

By investing in collective efforts in life extension one is not only helping other people, but increases changes of his own survival. 

For example, imagine a situation where society consists of rational egoists who each has 100 000 USD. They have two options to spend them: or fund scientific project, which costs 10 billions, or wait until creation of the antiaging drug and spend their fortune on buying it. If all of them cooperate, they spent all of their money on scientific research, and after it finished, they get antiaging therapy for free. If everybody defects, nobody is able to buy really working solution as it is not created. So it is very similar to Prisoner dilemma.

If some cooperate, and some defect, they don’t have enough money to finish the research, so they later have to sell it to the defectors. In that case the situation become more complex as richest defectors will get the drug first, and understanding of that encourage defection.

In other words, if someone is rich, he could donate all he has, and make closer “immortality” for everyone, for example, 1 million dollars will be 10 days difference of the immortality day. But he also could wait until someone else creates antiaging solution, and buy it for himself. Such situation may encourage defection.

But in fighting aging it is not good to be the first one who will buy most expensive solution. Because best solution must be tested, and the best testing is if it is used by millions of people, which provides needed statistics. (And there a lot of people who want to test anything on them for free, as we could see from the field of nootropics, where people take a lot of risk, so it will not be exportation).

So rational egoist must understand that any antiaging solution must be cheap, as it will give opportunity to test it almost for free on poorer people, so he will be sure that it is actually works.

The similar situation is with smartphones. Iphone could exist only because it is mass-market product. If someone tried to built just one Iphone 20 years ago, he would pay billions and get extremely glitchy and boring device.

### 4.5. Rational egoist is interested in maximizing money he has on time he can use them

Most contemporary rational egoists, which are backbone of the capitalism measure value in the form of money. 

But the real value cones not from the money, but from money multiplied on time the one owns them. For example if one buys expensive house, he will get value from the time he is able to live in it. If he owns it just 1 second, it doesn’t have value.

So really rational egoist should measure his fortune not in millions, but in million-years, that is integral of his fortune on time. Lets name it time-fortune. 

And where is one peculiar property of such fortune: any amount of money becomes zero in the moment of death or the rational egoist. (It is not the case for effective altruist who may will his money for charity.)

So, there is two ways to increase it this time-fortune: to earn more money, or to live longer. (We could also add here that personal utility of money is not linear, so doubling of fortune is not doubling of happiness and on some level there is saturation.) So to live longer is serious untapped source of increasing time-fortune.

Of cause there is time-discounting of future earning. But if there is a probability of infinite life span, even a very steep discount rate and even very small probability of immortality will still produce infinite time-fortune. 

But it depends of the law of discounting. If discounting is 1/x its integral is infinite. If it is exponential, it is finite, bit still could be very large. 

The example of discounting: ask people, how much they would pay now to live 97 years instead of 93. When ask the same question, but add that anyone who survived to 95 will be able to live as much as he wants.

So discounting is not working if our expected returns are expected to increase exponentially with time.

### 4.6. Fighting aging and betting on effective strategy

Taking any antiaging drug is a bet that it will work. The bet is based on two probabilities:

That this drug is working at all in the population, that is on the level of prove that it will fight aging.

On natural randomness of the aging process, which could or could not be affected by a particular drug for you.

Basically we want to increase both probabilities. (And lower risks and price.) 

First probability depends of scale of scientific efforts that support the drug, that is the number and quality of the experiments.

The second could be affected by measuring personal reaction to the drug, that is general parameters of health and biomarkers of aging.

And this result in two strategies: one is to try to take not so well proved drugs, that is geroprotectors candidates, hoping that one of them would work, and compensate this ambiguity by measuring personal health parameters.

Another strategy is to wait (and lose time for effective application of the drugs, as most of them should be taken earlier in life) until better prove will be provided by science.

### 4.7. Effective Altruism as arbitrage between different domains

Effective altruism works as arbitrage between different domains with different costs of saving a human life, and to be really effective, it has to find new effective ways of intervention or new “cheap” domains.

So there are two ways forward for Effective Altruism:

Find a new intervention, which more effectively helps people in our domain.

Find another domain, where interventions are much cheaper, e.g. poor countries, animal suffering and remote future generations.

In the first case, one could combine EA and rational egoism because everything that helps people in our domain could help that person and his/her relatives with some probability. So if one donates to a cancer research foundation, there is a small probability that it would help that person directly in the future. As aging is a universal disease, aging work would help that person with high probability.

In the second case, ontological differences between domains are exploited. Helping animals is likely to be cost-effective because animals can’t help themselves. Helping future generations is neglected because future generations cannot advocate for themselves. Old people are also not effective advocates for themselves, as aging prevents them from clear rational thinking or going out to streets to demand and defend their basic right – to be alive.

Fighting aging combines both approaches. It finds new domain, which affects everybody in our own domain: because everybody will become old one day.

### 4.8. Against obsession with future generations: people living now are important.

Infinite future generations could make extremely large changes in our estimation of the value of currently living people. Example: Bostrom

A lot of bad things in the human history had happened for the sake of the future generations, like repressions by communists. One could get approval for any course if action if he some how shows that in increase number of happy people in the future. As it can’t be measured, it opens the door for manipulation.

For example one may kill another person, but promise that he will procreate 2 children for each of his killing. Even if he can’t personally realize this promise, he could pay another person to make more children, or to give a charity that is against abortions. So giving a vote to future generations is misleading, because we could manipulate this number to get desired outcome, or just pretend that we may manipulate.

In the infinite universe all possible people exist, so in fact we can’t change the number of people who will exist in general.

If we understand this manipulative and foggy nature of future generations, we could actually pinpointed cases where we should care about them, and try generalize based in them.

Clearly we should build safer building, dig radioactive waste deeper etc. If we fight aging now it will make life of inborn people better. But if we sacrifice lives of people now for manipulating infinite unobservable numbers of the future generations, we probably just overestimate our ability to predict the future.

Yes, survival of the human civilization is very important, but if we claim that we will ignore any needs of currently living people for it, it would have negative PR value.

### 4.9. Life extension as a universal instrumental goal and good final goal

To do almost anything valuable a human must be alive. (He could scarify his life to save lives of other people, of he could want to die, because of depression or out of curiosity, but it is clear extremes.)

Humans are also has built in desire to be alive as one of the strongest final goals. Most people will prefer to remain alive to all other things not because they know how they will use their life but because it is their strong final goal. (Only desire to save the life of the other one or to escape strong physical or mental pain could overshadow the desire to be alive. Some people want to die because they lost feeling of purpose).

It is very human to want to be alive anyway, and if a person is not interested to be alive, it is considered as a disease. 

It is clear that natural selection created and deeply encoded the desire to be alive on many levels in human brain.

Desire to be alive is “good final goal” as it doesn’t contradict other instrumental goals and doesn’t depend per se from other people well being. People could cooperate achieving this goal. Final goals of, for example, serial killer, don’t have these properties.

Some may said that personal life extension is too egoistic, especially if preserving life of old terminally ill patient eats resources which could be spent on well being of younger people. This is exactly want we want escape by suggesting fighting aging before it creates such burdens.

### 4.10. Value of honesty

Fighting aging and death is one of most complex tasks on the world. We can’t solve it if we add other tasks, like earn money selling life extension drug. We will always end with snake oil, as it is more effective way to money.

Only honest ethically sound people could actually fight with death, and we need as much such people as possible.

## Conclusion

Geroprotectors are likely the cheapest way to fight aging as most research on their safety, chemistry and side effects has been already done. There are other approaches but they require much research de novo, like genetic therapy of aging. They also could increase risks of dual use technology.

Many promising geroprotectors are over-the-counter drugs or almost freely available. Pharmaceutical companies can’t earn money on them, and people don’t know about the potential of them for slowing aging. Funding geroprotectors is a promising place where altruistic action could create a large amount of good.

The actual personal strategy to indefinite life extension may include something like surfing the wave of new technologies to get longevity escape velocity. 

To slow down aging is the first and simplest step on this way. More sophisticated approaches will appear later and will give longer life expectancy.
